# Algo-Visualizer

## Inspiration
Everyone around is trying to learn programming and become great software developers at tech giants, but the most basic thing that everyone starts learning form are basic algorithms. there is no better way to learn other than visualization of concepts, so we decided to make an app that helps beginners grasp difficult concepts and become **great developers**.

## What it does
It contains several sorting, searching and graph algorithms. Aiming towards making understanding easier through visualization 

## How we built it
we have used Python and used  Tkinter It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

## Challenges we ran into
Learning new algos and working on them to make sure that they work visually, user-friendly design.
First time experiencing how a team works, _how the work of one person affects the whole team_
not using version system like git from the start resulted in a mess, even in a small 2-day hackathon codes were all over the place, using git could reduce all this confusion.

**Still were grateful for this opportunity and also for our difficulties as we got to learn and gain experience which will help us perform better in future hackathons** 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making a finished product within 2 days which can be beneficial for a lot of purpose 
i)for beginners at understanding difficult algorithms
ii)Can be used as a teaching tool at schools and colleges.

Working as a team on a project with talented people, keeping with others and learning new things and skills along the way.
 
## What we learned
Learnt a lot of algos in the process of making this application. Learnt to use appropriate technology and sharing of code using git.

## What's next for Algo Visualizer
There is a lot of room to grow as this was only a trailer of our original vision. We will try to make the visualizer more appealing  and adding more and more algos and try to add more theory content for beginners and make it a must-have teaching tool.
